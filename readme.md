## by James A. Hinds

This is a version of tiny basic that appears in issue #55, May 1981 issue of [Dr. Dobbs Journal of Computer Calisthenics & Orthodontia](https://www.drdobbs.com).

Road Map:

1. Transcribe [source code](09-BAS.asm) to text with minimal changes
2. Transcribe original [article](article.md) to markdown
3. Port source to work with [LWTOOLS](http://www.lwtools.ca/manual/index.html) '09 compiler
4. Document I/O to allow easy porting to various '09 SBC
