## by James A. Hinds

This is a version of tiny basic that appears in issue #55, May 1981 issue of [Dr. Dobbs Journal of Computer Calisthenics & Orthodontia](https://www.drdobbs.com).

Road Map:

1. Transcribe [source code](09-BAS.asm) to text with minimal changes
2. Transcribe original [article](article.md) to markdown
3. Port source to work with one or more modern 6809 assemblers
   * [LWTOOLS](http://www.lwtools.ca/manual/index.html) '09 assembler
   * [A09](https://github.com/Arakula/A09) - 6800/6801/6809/6301/6309/68HC11 Assembler
   * [ASM6809](https://www.6809.org.uk/asm6809/) is a portable cross assembler targeting the Motorola 6809 and Hitachi 6309.
4. Document I/O to allow easy porting to various '09 SBC
